                <p>Akan names are of a Ghanian origin.</p>
                <p>Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name based on their gender as
                    well as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they
                    were born.</p>
                <p>This application will take your date birth and compute which day of the week you were 
                    born then assign you the appropriate Akan Name! How cool is that?!</p>
